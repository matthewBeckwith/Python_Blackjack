# Python_Blackjack

A standalone Blackjack Game, built with Python

I found this code sitting in a hard drive and I like the base. This is a Game I like to build over and over again when I learn something new or I am trying out a new language because it contains all of the things I would need to use. This version will be a study of PyGame.
